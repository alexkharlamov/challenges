# Back End Challenges
You will find two assignments in the sub-folders here, each with specific instructions on the assignment. 
1. The first is a review challenge, intended to gauge your ability to spot code issues. (30 minutes)
2. The second is a set of implementation challenges, intended to gauge your understanding and familiarity with writing 
performant and scalable code. It assumes familiarity with Java 8, which is our primary back-end language. (4 hours, 30 minutes)

Please work on **all** of them. We ask that you spend no more than 5 hours in total working on these.

Also, know that we care more about quality rather than how far you get. If you’re not able to finish in 5 hours, 
please don’t sweat it.
