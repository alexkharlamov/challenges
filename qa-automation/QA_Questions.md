# QA Challenge

1.  UI automation test
Given the following site: https://www.saucedemo.com/
Write the proper automation tests for the following scenarios:
	- Login as locked_out_user and verify that the user is locked out.
	- Login as standard_user and purchase all the T-shirts
	- Login as problem_user and verify if all the images are loading correctly.
	
To create the tests above, write an automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with **JAVA**, MAVEN, and TestNG.


2.  API automation test
Create a test to get weather using Open Weather API in the city of London: http://openweathermap.org/current
Write three automation tests that you consider necessary to validate that the API is working as expected. We suggest using Rest Assured.


This test will be evaluated by the Yieldstreet Engineering team. If you're having any issues with the challenge, feel free to contact us. Good Luck!
