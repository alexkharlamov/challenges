# Challenge 2 - Programming and Creative
### (3 to 3.5 hrs)

For this assignment you'll be using your tech chops and your eye for pixel perfection. Using the provided design assets, we ask you to create an implemention of one of the two options below: (you will not be able to completely finish in 3.5 hours so be dillegent in selecting which elements you implement. We care more the quality of your code than how far you get). 

#### Option 1: Newsletter
The newsletter is a very important touchpoint with our users and we send it out once a month to more than 10,000 people and organizations across the country. It usually contains a combination of: new features, products, new articles, new blog posts, featured messages, user requests, new event etc.

Please use the design asset: *[`Newsletter`](https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=58bd788a01ee60c44b2ff3bd&sid=58bd79636491fcb463d74fea)* *(We will send you a Zeplin invitation shortly)* to create your implementation. 

We have not attached any mobile design assets, so use your creativity and judgement to make sure everything is readable, understandable and looks good on mobile screens.

As you implement the design, please be sure to use mailsafe html (hint: use tables) and css (you can use this link as guide). For all our emails we aim to support, in some form (graceful degradation): Outlook 2007/10/13/16, outlook.com, ipad, iphone 6, android gmail, AOL, gmail.com and Yahoo.com.

*Purpose: This assignment helps us understand your level of expertise and knowledge of CSS and HTML limitations.*

#### Option 2: Marketplace 
The YieldStreet marketplace is the most important page on our platform and to this day, more than $100M has been funneled through here.

Some of the required aspects for the marketplace design and layout is: trust, visibility, readability, urgency, easy to understand.

Please use the design asset: [`Marketplace`](https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=58bd788a01ee60c44b2ff3bd&sid=58c023ddf753a78833238385) *(We will send you a Zeplin invitation shortly)* to create your implementation. If you know how, please use SASS with BEM syntax.

*Purpose: This assignment helps us understand your level of expertise and knowledge of building responsive modular front-ends, helps us gauge your level of design perfection and also gives us a sense of your creative skills around organization and presentation of information.*

Good luck!
