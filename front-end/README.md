# Front End Challenges

You will find two assignments in the sub-folders here, each with specific instructions on the assignment. 

1. The first is a QA challenge, intended to gauge your eye for detail and yen for pixel-perfectness.
2. The second is a creative and programming assignment. This is intended to gauge both your design/creative chops and your raw programming skills with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, SASS.

Please work on **both** of them. The second one has a couple of options to choose from. We ask that you spend no more than 3-4 hours in total working on these. 

Also, know that we care more about quality rather than how far you get. If you’re not able to finish in 4 hours then please don’t sweat it.
