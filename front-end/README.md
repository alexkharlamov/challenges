# Front End Challenges
You will find three assignments in the sub-folders here, each with specific instructions on the assignment. 
1. The first is a QA challenge, intended to gauge your eye for pixel-perfectness and visual detail. (30 minutes)
2. The second is a Pull Request Review challenge, intended to gauge your eye for code detail and best practices. (30 minutes)
3. The third is a creative and programming assignment. This is intended to gauge both your design/creative chops and your raw programming skills with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (4 hours)

Please work on **all** of them. We ask that you spend no more than 5 hours in total working on these.

Also, know that we care more about quality rather than how far you get. If you’re not able to finish in 5 hours, please don’t sweat it.
