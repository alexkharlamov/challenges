# Challenge 1 - QA
### (15 to 30 min)

You will find two screenshots in this folder: `#1.png` and `#2.png` Compare the two screenshots. #1 is the original design asset produced by the creative team. #2 is an HTML and CSS implementation by a front-end engineer on the team.

Question is - **did the engineer get it right?** Evaluate the implementation in regards to colors, fonts, font sizes, etc. In other words, find as many mistakes in #2 as you can. Circle and annotate them on #2. 

Good luck!
