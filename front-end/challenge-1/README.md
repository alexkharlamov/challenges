# Challenge 1 - PR Review
### (~30 min)

You'll find a JS file in this folder: `PullRequestChallenge.js`. Evaluate the file/"PR" in regards to best practices (readability, contemporary code patterns, commenting if appropriate, etc) and decide whether you would approve the Pull Request. 

Comment right in the file where you would have commented during your pull request review on a github page, and add your final feedback of whether you would approve this PR, and why or why not, at the bottom of the file. 

Good luck!
