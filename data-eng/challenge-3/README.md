You are given a simple CSV file, _payments.csv_, with the following columns:
* user_id
* payment_amount
* payment_date

You need to make a table, _PAYMENTS_BY_MONTH_, with the following columns:
```
user_id
month_1_total_paid
month_2_total_paid
â€¦
month_N_total_paid
```

For each user,
* Month 1 total is the total amount they paid in the first month that they made payments
* Month 2 payment is the total amount paid in the subsequent month
* Month n payment is the total paid in the last month they made payments

Additionally,
* the value of N will be the max such n value among all users
* if no payments were made in a certain month after their first payment, then the value must be zero for that entry
* for a given user, if n < N then all payments after month n will be zero.

Write code that will generate a CSV file containing the table PAYMENTS_BY_MONTH
