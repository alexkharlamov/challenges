# Data Engineering Challenges
You will find four challenges in the sub-folders here

All challenges and questions are directly modeled on
  scenarios that the data team at Yieldstreet has faced.

The first challenge is simply a set of questions to answer (30 minutes or less)

The second and third challenge are short scenarios. They should take 30-60 minutes each.

The fourth challenge is a more detailed scenario. It should take about 1-2 hours.

 We want to know how you would handle such scenarios. Note that this role is open to all skills levels. Feel free to complete as much of the challenge as possible. If you run out of time for coding,
 please describe what your code would do in the comments.

You will not be given any data for these challenges.
Part of the challenge is to create your own data to use to test your code.
