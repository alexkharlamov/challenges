# Mobile (React Native) Challenges
You will find two assignments in the sub-folders here, each with specific instructions on the assignment. 
1. The first is a Pull Request Review challenge, intended to gauge your eye for code detail and best practices. (~30 minutes)
1. The second is a creative and programming assignment. This is intended to gauge both your design/creative chops and your raw programming skills with mobile technologies, specifically React Native. (~4 hours)

Please work on **all** of them. We ask that you spend no more than 5 hours in total working on these.

Also, know that we care more about quality rather than how far you get. If you’re not able to finish in 5 hours, please don’t sweat it.
